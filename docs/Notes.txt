Android PWA requires an 512x512 icon and 192x192 icon set in manifest.json
The 512 image is used for the splash screen logo. The splash background color
is set in manifest.json.

Apple device icons must be added via meta tags in head, must be square, and not 
have transparent backgrounds. These are optional, but device generated icons
may not be as good.

iOS requires specifically sized png images for splash screens.
